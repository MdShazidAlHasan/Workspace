Question-2:
You will be given a dictionary where the key indicates a person who will 
receive presents and value indicates the list of people from whom he/she 
will receive the presents.
For example in the dictionary {'Alex': ['Carl', 'Ethan'], 'Bob': 
['Carl', 'David'], 'Carl': ['David', 'Alex'], 'David': ['Alex']} Alex will 
receive gifts from Carl and Ethan, Bob will receive from Carl and David and 
so on.
You have to create a dictionary where the givers will be the keys and the 
list of people receiving gifts from him/her will be the values 
corresponding to those keys.
======================================================
Given dictionary 1:
{'Alex': ['Carl', 'Ethan'], 'Bob': ['Carl', 'David'], 'Carl': 
['David', 'Alex'], 'David': ['Alex']}

Sample output 1:
{'Carl': ['Alex', 'Bob'], 'Ethan': ['Alex'], 'David': 
['Bob', 'Carl'], 'Alex': ['Carl', 'David']}

Explanation 1:
We can see that Carl will give gifts to Alex and Bob. So the value 
corresponding to the key Carl will be a list containing both Alex and Bob. 
Similarly all the other keys are handled.
